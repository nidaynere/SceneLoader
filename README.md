-Loads scenes asynchronously from asset bundle.<br>
-Reads asset bundles from StreamingAssets/scenes.<br>
-Smoothly open/close UI panels.<br>
-Random hints on UI Loading panel. Auto change hints in 7 seconds loop. Dev can change hints at StreamingAssets/hint.json.<br>
-Flying objects on sky with World Canvas hud.
<br>

Missing ones.<br>
-Unit tests.<br> I guess no need because I made a UI with buttons. Put your scene files to Unity_Data/StreamingAssets/scenes/ and it will create a UI button for it.<br>
-Not tested on VR because my I failed to run my Oculus Development Kit 1 (old Oculus). But I guess the project may work because I developed with my memories while I was working with HTC Vive once.
